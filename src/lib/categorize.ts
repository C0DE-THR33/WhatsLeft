// Deterministic merchant-name categorization: the "rules first" half of
// CONVENTIONS.md #1's "rules first, LLM for ambiguous cases".
//
// Pure and dependency-free on purpose (#2) — no database, no network, no
// Prisma types — so it can be verified with a plain script (#8). The
// caller resolves the returned CategoryIcon to an actual Category row.
//
// THREE THINGS THIS GETS RIGHT THAT A NAIVE VERSION WOULD NOT:
//
// 1. Word boundaries, not substrings. `"UBER"` inside a narration is a
//    ride; `"OLA"` as a substring also appears in CHOCOLATE, SOLAR,
//    GORILLA and TESLA. Substring matching on short merchant names is
//    actively wrong, and the failure is silent — a chocolate purchase
//    quietly filed under Transport. Everything here matches whole words.
//
// 2. Brands beat generic keywords. This is a TIER, not a length
//    comparison. "Metro Card Recharge" is a transport top-up, but the
//    generic keyword RECHARGE (bills) is a longer string than the brand
//    METRO — so sorting by length alone silently filed it under Bills.
//    Brands are checked first as a class; only if none match does the
//    generic keyword pass run.
//
// 3. Within a tier, longer phrases win. "AMAZON PRIME" (entertainment)
//    must beat "AMAZON" (shopping), and it does without any hand-ordering
//    of the table below.

// why they must never outrank a real merchant name.
// Everyday words, including the ones people actually type into the cash
// sheet. That entry point is free text rather than a bank's merchant
// field, so this tier carries far more weight there than it does for
// synced rows — "Auto rickshaw" and "chai" are the realistic inputs, and
// both were unmatched until a manual entry exposed it.
//
// Plurals are listed explicitly. Matching is on whole tokens, so GROCERIES
// is simply a different word from GROCERY; stripping a trailing S
// automatically would turn BUS into BU.
